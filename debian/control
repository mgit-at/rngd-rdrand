Description: Simple rngd to collect entropy from Intel's rdrand
 A simple rngd to collect entropy from Intel's Bull Mountain hwrng using the
 `rdrand` instruction and feed it to the kernel's /dev/random pool.
 It also throws a bit of extra entropy into /dev/urandom, because rdrand is
 so cheap so why not?
